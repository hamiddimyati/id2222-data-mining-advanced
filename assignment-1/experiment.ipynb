       "'In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a way to form new classes (instances of which are called objects) using classes that have already been defined. The inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for Simula. The new classes, known as derived classes, take over (or inherit) attribute and behaviour of the pre-existing classes, which are referred to as base classes (or ancestor classes). It is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification. Inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages. Categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing, crucial to human learning by means of generalization (what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established) and cognitive economy (less information needs to be stored about each specific entity, only its particularities). Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For instance, a \"fruit\" is a generalization of \"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\" and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple, orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant. An advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code, reducing the complexity of the program. Inheritance therefore has another view, a dual, called polymorphism, which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code. Inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding (replacing) one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor. '"

       "' In probability theory, Bayes\\' theorem also called Bayes\\' law after Rev Thomas Bayes compares the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. It is often used to calculate posterior probabilities given observations. For example, a patient may be observed to have certain symptoms. Bayes\\' theorem can be used to calculate the likelihood that a proposed analysis is accurate, given that observation. As an official theorem, Bayes\\' theorem is valid in all universal interpretations of probability. However, it plays a fundamental role in the debate around the foundations of statistics: frequentist and Bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications. Frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of happening or to subsets of populations as proportions of the whole. Whilst Bayesians describe probabilities in terms of beliefs and degrees of uncertainty. The articles on Bayesian probability and frequentist probability discuss these debates in greater detail. Bayes\\' theorem compares the conditional and marginal probabilities of events A and B, where B has a non-vanishing probability. Each term in Bayes\\' theorem has a conventional name: P(A) is the previous probability of A. It is \"previous\" in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B. P(A|B) is the conditional probability of A, given B. It is also called the subsequent probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of B. P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A. P(B) is the previous. '"
